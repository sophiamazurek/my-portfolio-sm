                My name is Sophia Mazurek and I graduated from the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh in May 2020. From UWO i recieved 
                a BBA in Marketing with an emphasis in Digital Media. While I was at UWO I was a member of the Women's Golf Team and 
                competed in the Division Three WIAC Confrence. 

                Oshkosh also allowed me to do what I love which is travel the world. My senior year I studied abroad at Lorenzo de Medici 
                for the month of January. In Florence I studied International Marketing, this helped me see the world in a different perspective
                in terms of marketing and business as a whole.

                In this section I would like to show off some of my work! The first piece you will see if a video that I made that was from a fundraiser that
                I was apart of. It was for Youth on Course, where we played 100 holes of golf so that we could raise money for YOC program which helps fund children who play
                golf. The second piece is an ongoing project that I am working on with my class. We are creating a website and learning all the different tools and skill with website development.
                The last piece is from our first week in coding bootcamp where we looked at a websites code and cleaned it up a little bit to make it more user friendly.
